# Introduction

This notebook serves as an introduction to the data. This notebook covers data loading (and saving) and basic descriptive peeks. 

## Session Information and Configuration

```{r}
library(DataExplorer)
library(naniar)
library(pastecs)
library(psych)
library(data.table)
library(plyr)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
```


This section outputs information regarding loaded dependencies and OS configuration that may help in trouble-shooting. 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

```{r}
sapply(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'IRkernel'), function(p) paste(packageVersion(p)))
```

Check the working directory. Expected to be a the 'project' level for knit. 

```{r}
getwd()
```


# Custom Data Read Functions
This section contains code "blocks"" for saving data in different file formats for ingestion into different downstream programs. The source code for these functions is in the file `code/load_and_convert_functions.R` for re-use in analysis notebooks. The following function loads data from the `code/load_and_convert_functions.R` file to the current workspace.

```{r}
source('code/load_and_convert_functions.R')
```

## Sample Data 

An example of loading the sample data into a `data.frame` from a MS Excel file:

```{r}
# df <- read_xlsx_from_path(filepath = '../../local_data/DS_PreprocessedAnonymized_Text.xlsx')
```


## Demographics

### Demographics Data Load

2,051 (not including header row)

```{r}
# Local path specifications
# demographics_path <- '../../local_data/full_data/Demographics.dsv'
demographics_path <- 'data/full_set/Demographics.dsv'

demo_raw <- read_multi_character_delim_fast(demographics_path, v=FALSE, "<break>", header = TRUE)
nrow(demo_raw) #Expect 2052 total records (first record is a header).
```

```{r}
# View(demo_raw)
names(demo_raw)
head(demo_raw)
```

### Demographics Data Type Transformation

Here we handle each variable separately. This doesn't scale as data gets wider, so we will use `plyr::colwise(type.convert)([data.frame])` in the future and clean-up elements like dates.

```{r}
demo_df <- transform(demo_raw, 
                    STUDY_PAT_ID = as.factor(STUDY_PAT_ID),
                    SOURCE_DATABASE = as.factor(SOURCE_DATABASE),
                    GENDER = as.factor(GENDER),
                    BIRTH_DATE = as.Date(BIRTH_DATE, format='%m-%d-%Y'),
                    DEATH_DATE = as.Date(DEATH_DATE, format='%m-%d-%Y'),
                    PATIENT_DECEASED = as.factor(PATIENT_DECEASED),
                    AGE_CUR_OR_AT_DEATH = as.numeric(AGE_CUR_OR_AT_DEATH),
                    RACE = as.factor(RACE),
                    ETHNICITY = as.factor(ETHNICITY),
                    EDUCATION_YEARS = as.character(EDUCATION_YEARS), # this will require separate handling cleaning 
                    EXAM_COUNT = as.numeric(EXAM_COUNT),
                    FIRST_EXAM_DATE = as.Date(FIRST_EXAM_DATE, format='%m-%d-%Y'),
                    LAST_EXAM_DATE = as.Date(LAST_EXAM_DATE, format='%m-%d-%Y'),
                    DEMENTIA_DX_BILL_CLAR = as.factor(DEMENTIA_DX_BILL_CLAR),
                    DEMENTIA_DX_CLIN_CLAR = as.factor(DEMENTIA_DX_CLIN_CLAR),
                    DEMENTIA_DX_BILL_HSDW = as.factor(DEMENTIA_DX_BILL_HSDW),
                    DEMENTIA_DX_CLIN_HSDW = as.factor(DEMENTIA_DX_CLIN_HSDW)
                    )

sapply(demo_df, class)
```

```{r}
str(demo_df)
```

### Demographics Missing Values

String value of "NA" not converted to true `NA`. Here we convert this explicitly.

```{r}
demo_df$EDUCATION_YEARS[demo_df$EDUCATION_YEARS == "NA" ] <- NA
```


```{r}
DataExplorer::introduce(demo_df)
```

We'll use the package `nanair` to visualize missing patterns. See the [documentation here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naniar/vignettes/naniar-visualisation.html). There's a lot more than can be done with this package. 

We can see that `DEATH_DATE` and `EDUCATION_YEARS` have missing values. From the Data Dictionary:

   - `DEATH_DATE`: "Patient's date of death, if deceased, otherwise null"
   - `EDUCATION_YEARS`: "Patient's highest education level.  This is a free text field in MiChart.  Usually it contains a count of the number of years, buth occasionally a text entry is made, such as "Masters". Many are null."

```{r}
naniar::vis_miss(demo_df)
```

We see 1133 values where `DEATH_DATE` and `EDUCATION_YEARS` are missing simultaneously.

```{r}
naniar::gg_miss_upset(demo_df)
```


### Demographics Descriptive Statistics

Here are high-level (naive) 5 number summaries for each column, excluding `STUDY_PAT_ID`.

```{r}
summary(demo_df[,-1])
```


```{r}
psych::describe(demo_df)
```

### Demographics Vizualization

**TO DO** Handle the messiness in the education field.



```{r}
DataExplorer::plot_bar(demo_df$EDUCATION_YEARS)
```

```{r}
DataExplorer::plot_histogram(demo_df$AGE_CUR_OR_AT_DEATH)
```

## Encounters

### Excounter Data Load
Expect 304573 records (first record is a header).

```{r}
gc()

# # local path specifications
# encounters_path <- '../../local_data/full_data/Encounters.dsv'
encounters_path <- 'data/full_set/Encounters.dsv'

enc_df_raw <- read_multi_character_delim_fast(encounters_path, v=FALSE, "<break>", header = TRUE)
nrow(enc_df_raw)
```


```{r}
names(enc_df_raw)
```


### Encounter Data Type Transformation

Here we guess at most column data type conversions and handle the mistakes explicitly.

```{r}
enc_df <- plyr::colwise(type.convert, na.strings = "NA", as.is = TRUE)(enc_df_raw)
str(enc_df)
```

```{r}
date_fields <- grep("DATE", names(enc_df_raw), value = TRUE)
lengths(regmatches(enc_df[, date_fields], gregexpr("NA", enc_df[, date_fields])))
```

```{r}
sapply(as.character(enc_df$COMORBIDITY_ADMIT_DATE[1:10]), print)[[1]]
```


We need to handle date fields.

```{r}
enc_df  <- transform(enc_df,
                     ADMIT_DATE = as.Date(as.character(ADMIT_DATE), format='%m-%d-%Y %H:%M'),
                     DISCH_DATE = as.Date(as.character(DISCH_DATE), format='%m-%d-%Y %H:%M'),
                     COMORBIDITY_ADMIT_DATE = as.Date(as.character(COMORBIDITY_ADMIT_DATE), format='%m-%d-%Y'))

str(enc_df[,date_fields])
```

```{r}
# naniar::vis_miss(enc_df[, date_fields], warn_large_data=FALSE)
```

Handle factor conversions manually.

```{r}
enc_df  <- transform(enc_df,
                     ENC_SOURCE_DATABASE = as.factor(ENC_SOURCE_DATABASE),
                     PAT_CLASS = as.factor(PAT_CLASS),
                     ENC_TYPE = as.factor(ENC_TYPE),
                     DEPT_ABBR = as.factor(DEPT_ABBR),
                     FIN_CLASS = as.factor(FIN_CLASS),
                     COMORBIDITY_SOURCE_DATABASE = as.factor(COMORBIDITY_SOURCE_DATABASE)
                     )
      
str(enc_df)              
```

### Encounters Missing Values 

**TODO:** Finished handling missing data. 

```{r}
# enc_df_raw[enc_df_raw == "NA" ] <- NA
```



### Encounter Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
summary(enc_df)
```


### Comorbidities

Convert binary coomorbidities to factors.

```{r}
comorbidity_fields <- names(enc_df[sapply(enc_df, is.integer)])
enc_df[sapply(enc_df, is.integer)] <- lapply(enc_df[sapply(enc_df, is.integer)], as.factor)
```


Quick look at Charlson comorbidities.

```{r}
DataExplorer::plot_bar(enc_df[, comorbidity_fields])
```

## Labs


We use a bash script to look at the column names from the file directly.

```{bash}
echo "Column names:"
head -n 1 data/full_set/Labs.dsv | tr ',' '\n' # print columns nicely using bash
echo ""
echo "Number of Columns:"
head -n 1 data/full_set/Labs.dsv | sed 's/[^,]//g' | wc -c
# sed -n -e 252p data/full_set/Labs.dsv
```

It looks like 'Labs' is already a `.csv` file. Expect 1516205 records (first record is a header). However, there are some nuances that need to be handled (the text fields have commas that are not enclosed properly)

```{r}
# # local path specifications
# labs_path <- '../../local_data/full_data/Labs.dsv'
labs_path <- 'data/full_set/Labs.dsv'

labs_df <- read_labs(labs_path)
nrow(labs_df)
head(labs_df)
```


```{r}
names(labs_df)
```


```{r}
DataExplorer::introduce(labs_df)
```

## Notes
Expect 11078079 records (first record is a header).

**WARNING:** the following file is magnitudes larger than the others and requires a long time (and a lot of memory) to load. Proceed with caution.

```{r}
notes_path <- '../../local_data/full_data/Notes.dsv'
```



```{r}
gc()
source('code/load_and_convert_functions.R')
note_df <- read_notes_custom_delim(notes_path, v=FALSE, '<break>', header = TRUE)
nrow(note_df)
```

```{r}
radiology_path <- '../../local_data/full_data/Radiology.dsv'
```


```{r}
gc()
radio_df <- read_multi_character_delim_fast(radiology_path, v=FALSE, "<break>", header = TRUE)
nrow(radio_df)

#Apppendix: Custom Load and Convert Functions 

Below is a bash shell commad to print the functions in `code/load_and_convert_functions.R` to the console:

```{bash}
# cat code/load_and_convert_functions.R
```

# Appendix: Saving Data

## R Objects
R changes rapidly. File types specific to R may not be robust to future changes in technology. ** Note on `save`:** the R function `save` stores both the object and the name of the object. This is important when loading objects back into R. `.Rdata` (sometimes `.Rda`) files are specific to the R environment. They can store arbitrary numbers of objects in a single file. For more documentation I suggest: 
[YaRrr/rdata-files](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/rdata-files.html).

**Note for OSX Users:** The extension may matter. We have chosen `.Rdata`. Reference: [error-in-gzfilefile-wb-cannot-open-the-connection-or-compressed-file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15363076/error-in-gzfilefile-wb-cannot-open-the-connection-or-compressed-file).

The following block demonstrates saving both `.Rdata` or `.rds` format objects.

```{r}
# save_rData(df, 'sample.Rdata')
# save_rData(df, 'sample.rds')
```


## CSV
This is the most robust long-term file storage format. Note that there are several possible arguments for `write.csv()` that may be necessary to specify depending on downstream requirements.

```{r}
#  save_csv(df, '../../local_data/', 'mini_sample_test.csv')
```

```{r}
# save_csv(demo_df, '../../local_data/stuctured_csv_data/', 'demographics_test.csv')
# save_csv(enc_df, '../../local_data/stuctured_csv_data/', 'enounters_test.csv')
# save_csv(lab_df, '../../local_data/stuctured_csv_data/', 'labs_test.csv')
# save_csv(radio_df, '../../local_data/stuctured_csv_data/', 'radiology_test.csv')
```


Please recall that this data object is much larger than the others. 

```{r}
# save_csv(note_df, '../../local_data/structured_csv_data/', 'notes_test.csv')
```
